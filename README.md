# SQL Language Processor in Prolog for DES
This project focuses on the design and implementation of an SQL language processor in Prolog, aiming to improve the efficiency and performance of the deductive database system DES (Deductive Database System). The project specifically targets SQL, separating the lexical and syntactic analysis phases to offer greater flexibility, facilitate debugging, and allow the integration of new functionalities.

Objectives:

1. Design and develop a new processor for SQL in Prolog.
2. Enhance performance by separating the lexical and syntactic analysis phases.
3. Compare the performance between the current processor and the newly developed one to validate its functionality and efficiency.
